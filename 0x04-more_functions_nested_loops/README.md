Tasks

0.Writing a function that checks for uppercase character .Prototype: int _isupper(int c);Returns 1 if c is uppercase. Returns 0 otherwise

1.Writing  a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);Returns 1 if c is a digit Returns 0 otherwise

2.Writing a function that multiplies two integers. Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

3.Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.Prototype: void print_numbers(void);using  _putchar twice in my code

4.Writing a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void); not to print 2 and 4. only using _putchar twice in my code

5.Writing a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.Prototype: void more_numbers(void); using _putchar three times in my code

6. Writing a function that draws a straight line in the terminal. Prototype: void print_line(int n);using _putchar function to print. Where n is the number of times the character _ is printed. The line end with a \n. If n is 0 or less, the function to only print \n

7.Writing a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n); using _putchar function to print. Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed. The diagonal  ends with a \n.If n is 0 or less, the function to only print a \n

8.Writing a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.Prototype: void print_square(int size); using _putchar function to print. Where size is the size of the square. If size is 0 or less, the function to print only a new line. Using the character # to print the square

9.Writing a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. Each number or word should be separated by a space. I can  use the standard library

10.Writinga function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);only using _putchar function to print. Where size is the size of the triangle. where size is 0 or less, the function only a new line. Using the character # to print the triangle

 

11.Writing a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line. using the standard library. my program will be compiled with this command: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm

12.Writing a function that prints an integer. Prototype: void print_number(int n); only using _putchar function to print. allowed to use long.You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers. not allowed to hard-code special values
