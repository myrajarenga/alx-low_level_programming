focussing on pointers arrays and strings

0. Writing a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98. Using Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n)

1. Writing a function that swaps the values of two integers. Using Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b)

2. Writing a function that returns the length of a string. Using Prototype: int _strlen(char *s)

3. Writing a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. Using Prototype: void _puts(char *str)
4. Writing a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. Using Prototype: void print_rev(char *s)

5. Writing a function that reverses a string.Using Prototype: void rev_string(char *s)

6. Writing a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. Using Prototype: void puts2(char *str)

7. Writing a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. Using Prototype: void puts_half(char *str)

8. Writing a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. Using Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n) where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed. Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array. You are allowed to use printf.

9. Writing a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. Using Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src). Return value: the pointer to dest

10. Write a function that convert a string to an integer.Using Prototype: int _atoi(char *s).

11. Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
